Some students wrote over 30 pages in one hour attempting to refute the existence of the chair. One member of the class however, was up and finished in less than a minute. <br/><br/>\n\nWeeks later when the grades were posted, the rest of the group wondered how he could have gotten an A when he had barely written anything at all.
