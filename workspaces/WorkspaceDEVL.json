For summer appeals, you are required to meet with the PFE coach in the Educational Planning and Counseling Center at least once per term. You will have four weeks from the end of your first term of appeal to meet with your PFE coach. If you miss this deadline, you will be required to wait until two weeks after the beginning of your next term of enrollment to complete this requirement.<br/><br/>\n\nTo schedule your PFE appointment, you can go in person to the campus Educational Planning, Counseling, & Completion Office to get a contact card. Once received, you will set it up via the contact person on the card. Or, you may call 281-998-6150 to speak with the Educational Planning, Counseling, & Completion Office to schedule. <br/><br/>\n"
