The class was already seated and ready to go when the professor picked up his chair, plopped it on his desk and wrote on the board: \"Using everything we have learned this semester, prove that this chair does not exist.\" <br/><br/>\n\nFingers flew, erasers erased, notebooks were filled in furious fashion. Some students wrote over 30 pages in one hour attempting to refute the existence of the chair. One member of the class however, was up and finished in less than a minute. <br/><br/>\n\nWeeks later when the grades were posted, the rest of the group wondered how he could have gotten an A when he had barely written anything at all.

So his mom wrapped the book along with the checks up in a package and went to the post office to mail the money and the book. <br/><br/>\n\nWhen she gets back, her husband asked, \"Well how much did you give the boy this time?\" <br/><br/>\n\nShe said, \"Oh, I wrote two checks, one for \\$20 and the other for \\$1000 out to him.\" <br/><br/>\n\n\"That's \\$1020!\" yelled her husband. \"Are you crazy?\" <br/><br/>\n\n\"Don't worry, Hon,\" she said. \"I taped the \\$20 check to the cover of his book, but I put the \\$1000 one somewhere between the pages in chapter 19!\"<br/><br/>",
